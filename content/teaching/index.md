# Teaching & Course Notes

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE TO STUDENTS**
>
> While my lectures are delivered in **English**, please note that **all written materials (lecture notes, *polycopiés*, exam papers) are authored exclusively in French.**
>
> I maintain this policy not out of nostalgia, but necessity. French is the language of Bourbaki, of Grothendieck, and of Cartan. It possesses a topological rigidity and a structural nuance that modern globalized English lacks. If you wish to understand the geometry of latent spaces, you must first cross the barrier of language. Consider it your first filter.

### [Master 1] Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)
**Document:** *Théorie Homotopique des Types : Fondements Univalents pour l'Informaticien*

We reconstruct mathematics not on the shifting sands of set theory, but on the solid ground of types. Equality is treated not as a proposition, but as a **Path**.
*   **Core topics:** $\infty$-groupoids, Path Induction (J-rule), The Univalence Axiom.
*   **Tools:** The **Lean 4** theorem prover.
*   **Download:** [`hott_poly_2026.pdf`] (French, 175 pp.)

### [Master 2] Homotopic Foundations of Reasoning Architectures
**Document:** *Fondements Homotopiques des Architectures de Raisonnement*

We apply category theory to Generative AI. We analyze Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) through the lens of **Sheaf Theory**.
*   **Core theory:** The "Chain-of-Thought" is formalized as path induction. A "hallucination" is modeled as a topological obstruction ($H^1 \neq 0$) in the fiber bundle of knowledge.
*   **Download:** [`rag_topos_2026.pdf`] (French, 310 pp.)

### [Master 1] Geometric Vision via Clifford Algebras
**Document:** *Vision par Ordinateur : Des Fondations à l'Apprentissage Profond*

**Strict Prohibition:** The use of $3 \times 3$ rotation matrices is forbidden in this course.
We rebuild Computer Vision using **Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA)**. We treat the camera not as a matrix, but as a projector in a projective space, using Rotors and Motors for rigid body transformations. Includes 3D Gaussian Splatting derivations.
*   **Download:** [`vision_ga_final.pdf`] (French, 750 pp.)

### [Master 1] Earth Observation: From Sensor to Digital Twin
**Document:** *Télédétection Spatiale : Du capteur à l'application*

A physics-first approach to remote sensing. We do not simply process images; we solve the **Radiative Transfer Equation**.
*   **Core topics:** Polarization (Stokes Vectors), Interferometric SAR, and inverting physical models using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
*   **Download:** [`eo_physics.pdf`] (French, 1032 pp.)

### [Undergraduate L3] Category Theory and Poetry
**Document:** *Théorie des catégories et poésie*

*Optional Evening Seminar.*
An exploration of the Yoneda Lemma as the ultimate structure of metaphor. We read Mallarmé alongside Mac Lane.
*   **Material:** Handwritten notes distributed in class.
